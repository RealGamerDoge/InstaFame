## Install dependencies 

**1.** Download the Chrome driver for your Chrome version

**2** Install the file on your computer and copy the file location

**3.** Go into command prompt and type in `pip install selenium` and while your add it type in `pip install time` if you have not done so yet. If you like to make life easier then click on `install-dep.bat` to do most of the heavy lifting for you

## Edit Script

**1.** Go to the file called `main.py` and change the meaning of the `driver` variable into the location of the browser driver. Then go into the rest of the scripts and change the `accountPage` variable to whatever your Instagram page is.
